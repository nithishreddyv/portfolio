    <font size="4"><p>Data deduplication is a technique to eliminate duplicate data in order to save storage space and 
        enlarge upload bandwidth, which has been applied by cloud storage systems. However, a cloud storage 
        provider (CSP) may tamper user data or cheat users to pay unused storage for duplicate data that are
         only stored once. Although previous solutions adopt message-locked encryption along with Proof of 
         Retrievability (POR) to check the integrity of deduplicated encrypted data, they ignore proving 
         the correctness of duplication check during data upload and require the same file to be derived 
         into same verification tags, which suffers from brute-force attacks and restricts users from flexibly
        creating their own individual verification tags. In this paper, we propose a verifiable deduplication 
        scheme called Cloud Data Deduplication scheme to address the above problems. It can guarantee the 
    correctness of duplication check and support flexible tag generation for integrity check over encrypted 
    data deduplication in an integrative way. Concretely, we propose a novel Tag-flexible 
    Deduplication-supported Integrity Check Protocol (TDICP) based on Private Information Retrieval 
    (PIR) by introducing a novel verification tag called note set, which allows multiple users holding the 
    same file to generate their individual verification tags and still supports tag deduplication at the CSP.
     Furthermore, we make the first attempt to guarantee the correctness of data duplication check by 
     introducing a novel User Determined Duplication Check Protocol (UDDCP) based on Private Set Intersection (PSI), which can resist a CSP from providing a fake duplication check result to users. Security analysis shows the correctness and soundness of our scheme. Simulation studies based on real data show the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed scheme and its significant advantages over prior arts.

    <font size="4"><p>In this Project, we present a new identity-based PDP scheme for checking multicopy 
        on distributed cloud servers. The proposed scheme is proved secure under the CDH 
        assumption. Proposed scheme is designed to verify the integrity of multiple copies on 
        multiple cloud servers within one challenge-response interaction. Moreover, the structural 
        advantage of identity-based cryptography makes proposed scheme more efficient and secure 
        due to removing certificate management problem in PKI. In addition, proposed scheme 
        supports the feature of public verification.
