    <font size="4"><p>With the advancement of technology, it is imperative to exalt all the systems into a 
        user-friendly manner. The Library Management system (LMS) acts as a tool to transform traditional 
        libraries into digital libraries. In traditional libraries, the students/user has to search for books 
        which are hassle process and there is no proper maintenance of database about issues/fines. The overall
         progress of work is slow and it is impossible to generate a fast report. The librarians have to work 
         allotted for arranging, sorting books in the book sells. 
        At the same time, they have to check and monitor the lend/borrow book details with its fine. It is a
         tedious process to work simultaneously in different sectors. LMS will assist the librarians to work 
         easily. The LMS supports the librarians to encounter all the issues concurrently. The users need not 
         stand in a queue for a long period to return/borrow a book from the library. The single PC contains 
         all the data in it. The librarians have to a assess the system and provide an entry in it. Through 
         LMS the librarian can find the book in the book shelves.
       The LMS is designed with the basic features such as librarian can add/view/update/delete books and 
       students' details in it. Once he/she ingress into the system they can modify any data in the database.    The complete model is developed in Dot php technology, the php language is used to build the backend application.</p></font>

    <font size="4"><p>The hindrance and issues of the traditional library are identified and promote itto easy access for 
        the libraries. In the library management system, the librarian can add/update/remove the student and 
        book details into the database. the students have a unique ID for accessing for accessing any book 
        from the library. Through the ID, the librarian can check the user details, fine payment, and book d
        etails. the LMS reduces labour work and makes the system efficient. In future work, we planned to 
        enhance the LMS by integrating the LMS with local area network (LAN) which increases the efficiency 
        of the system.
